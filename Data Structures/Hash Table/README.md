# Hash Table

A hash table is a key-value data structure. Due to the lightning speed of querying a value through key, it is commonly used in Map, Dictionary or Object data structures. The hash table uses a hash function to convert keys into a list of numbers, and these numbers serve as the values of corresponding keys. To get value using key is dashingly fast, time complexity can achieve O(1). The same keys must return the same values - this is the basis of the hash function.

A Hash Table has some common methods:

- add: add a key-value pair.
- remove: delete a key-value pair.
- lookup: find a corresponding value using a key.
