# Stack

Stack follows the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out).
If you stack books, the top book will be taken before the bottom one. Or when you browse on internet, the back button leads you to the most recently browsed page.

It has some common methods:

- PUSH: input a new element
- POP: remove the top element, return the removed element.
- PEEK: return the top element.
- LENGTH: return the number of element(s) in Stack.
